title: "Robot Basic Competition:2D radar algorithm design and control code development"
excerpt: "  This is the selection competition of the Automation Academy for entering the Robocon team of the Robotics Academy. We use the traditional three-wheel omnidirectional wheel as the chassis, plus two U8 LITE as the friction belt motor. In the process, 2D radar is used to detect the cylinder, and finally, the radar automatically detects the cylinder alignment and launch score.<br/><img src='/images/ROBOCON_new.png'>"

**Main Contributions:**
  
  1. 2D radar algorithm
     
     Using radar can limit the angle and distance range of points, write code to extract the average value of points in a certain angle range and distance range
  
  2. Control code development

      We use STM32F407 as the main control chip to realize the control of the motor chassis, the writing of the final-state machine, the driving of the U8Lite motor, and the serial port code connected with the sensing part
