title: "A sports and health analyzer based on CNN-LSTM"
excerpt: "This project addresses the growing need for accessible foot health monitoring and early
disease detection. Inspired by national policies promoting healthcare innovation, it
leverages lightweight sensors and AI algorithms to identify foot deformities (e.g., flat feet)
and systemic risks (e.g., Parkinson's) through gait analysis. Unlike bulky clinical tools or basic
wearables, our solution offers real-time insights, personalized advice, and health alerts,
aiming to empower users with proactive care.You can [click here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sb42187km/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click&vd_source=809a8e4a3a25a8809f443b4da653e707)
