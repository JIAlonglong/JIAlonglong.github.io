After completing my undergraduate studies,I joined Professor Chen Changhao's PEAK_Lab at the HongKong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a research assistant,where I am responsible for research on leggedrobots.Currently,I focus on the
application of deep reinforcement learning in robot control and the whole-body control of robots,dedicated to enabling robots to accomplish a series of complex tasks through reinforcement learning.
my work is continuing!
