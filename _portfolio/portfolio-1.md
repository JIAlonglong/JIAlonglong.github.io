title: "Development of dexterous hands"
excerpt: "In the second semester of my senior year, I was fortunate to participate in the initial work of a startup company collaborating with laboratories from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HIT Shenzhen) and
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). As a robotic software engineer there, I specialized in ROS2 development and driver configuration (RS485/CAN) for a 22-DOF dexterous hand, along with the integration
of the UR16e robotic arm. I led the development of ROS2 Jazzy/Humble versions, which included: 
- Motion control systems and sensor data processing pipelines
- Communication module architecture for multi-device
