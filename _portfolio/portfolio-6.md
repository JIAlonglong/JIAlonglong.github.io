title: "Manipulator control,sensor collection,model building for
smart med - arms"
excerpt: "This is a laboratory project at Guangdong University of Technology. The purpose is to touch
the mass through the robotic arm and judge the size of the mass. In the experiment, we
used the Jaka robotic arm combined with a six-dimensional force sensor to slide the target
object (pork nugget) at different speeds, angles, and depths. Finally, we combined the LSTM
algorithm to perform a long-term sequence analysis of these data. Similarly, a feedback
control can also be performed on the robotic arm based on these data.<br/><img src='/images/arm.png'>"
