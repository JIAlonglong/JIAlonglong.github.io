# About Me ü§ñ

Hello! I'm Jialong Liu, a dedicated researcher and enthusiast in robotics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Robot Engineering from the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT) üéì. My academic journey and hands-on experiences have fueled a strong passion for robotic control algorithms, reinforcement learning, and intelligent system integration.

## Research Interests üîç
My primary focus lies in **robotic control algorithms** and **reinforcement learning (RL)**, with emphasis on developing efficient, adaptive control strategies for complex robotic systems. I am particularly fascinated by RL's potential to enable robots to learn and adapt in dynamic environments, as well as the synergy between machine learning techniques and traditional control theory to enhance robotic performance. Additionally, I have keen interests in Robot Operating System (ROS), motion planning, and unmanned system deployment‚Äîall of which contribute to my holistic understanding of robotics .

## Academic & Practical Experience üõ†Ô∏è
- **Research Assistant** | The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)  
  *June 2025 - Present*  
  Collaborating with Professor Changhao Chen on robotic control algorithms and unmanned system deployment, deepening expertise in advanced robotic systems .

- **Robotic Software Engineer Intern** | Botyard AI  
  *April 2025 - May 2025*  
  Led ROS development for dexterous hands and UR16e robotic arms using the ros2_control framework, implementing motion control, sensor data processing, and communication modules .

## Key Projects & Achievements üèÜ
My project portfolio spans diverse robotic applications, including developing decision-making algorithms for Robocon robots, designing control architectures for emergency-response spherical robots with ducted UAVs, and building smart medical arm systems .  

These efforts have earned recognition such as:  
- 1st Prize at the 22nd National College Student Robot Competition (ROBOCON)   
- 2nd Prize at the 23rd National College Student Robot Competition (ROBOCON) Operation Challenge   
- 3rd Prize at the 23rd National College Student Robot Competition (ROBOCON) Programming Challenge   
- National 2nd Prize at the 2024 RoboCom Robot Developer Competition   
- 1st Prize in Guangdong Province at the China Robot and Artificial Intelligence Competition   
- 2nd Prize at the Guangdong University Student Computer Works Competition   
- 3rd Class Annual Outstanding Student Scholarship at Guangdong University of Technology (2022-2023) .

## Technical Proficiency üíª
Skilled in:  
- Programming: C/C++, Python, JavaScript, MATLAB  
- Tools & Frameworks: ROS, Linux Ubuntu, STM32, Visual Studio, PyCharm  
- Fields: Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL) .

## Future Goals üöÄ
I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Master‚Äôs or Ph.D. degree to deepen my research in robotic control algorithms and reinforcement learning. I aim to collaborate with academic experts to address complex challenges in robotics and drive innovation in the field.
